A tool/app for students with reading disorders where they can type a word as input.📱
The app will then break down the word into chunks. 🅰🅰
The student will be able to tap on each chunk to hear a sound associated with each chunk.
They can then join the chunks to pronounce a word🍞🚗![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30589399/130322354-1a8b0fa6-bd3e-49a0-bf83-6e0f44b2c9c9.png)
